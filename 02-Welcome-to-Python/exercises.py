# Use the print function to output the text "I am a developer!"
# Remember -- case sensitivity matters in Python.
# All characters and casings must match the the ones in the string above.

print("I am a developer!")

# Use the print function to output the string "a ** b ** c"
# Make sure to use the proper keyword argument to separate the values.
# Don't cheat by manually copying and pasting the string.
print('a','b','c', sep = ' ** ')


# Help me out! When I print the two lines below, they are
# separated by a line break. What's peanut butter without
# jelly? NOTHING! Fix the code to ensure the second
# line picks up where the first line concludes. Your
# solution should have 2 print function calls.

print("Peanut butter and ", end = '')
print("jelly")
